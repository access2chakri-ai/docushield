# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the deployment optimization challenges with the current ARM64-only AgentCore runtime architecture. The system currently runs on AWS App Runner with each AI feature as its own Bedrock AgentCore runtime (Docker in ECR), using TiDB for both transactional SQL and vector embeddings. The primary concern is the longer build times associated with ARM64 architecture and the need to explore alternative deployment strategies that maintain performance while reducing deployment friction.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to understand the root cause of ARM64-only constraints in AgentCore, so that I can make informed decisions about alternative deployment strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the current AgentCore architecture THEN the system SHALL identify all hard dependencies that enforce ARM64-only deployment
2. WHEN examining Bedrock runtime requirements THEN the system SHALL determine if ARM64 constraint is policy-based or technical
3. WHEN reviewing compiled libraries and base images THEN the system SHALL document which components require ARM64 architecture
4. IF ARM64 constraint is policy-based THEN the system SHALL provide options for requesting architecture flexibility
5. WHEN dependency analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL produce a comprehensive report of ARM64 constraints

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want faster agent deployment options, so that I can iterate quickly during development and reduce time-to-production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating deployment alternatives THEN the system SHALL identify at least 3 viable deployment strategies
2. WHEN comparing deployment options THEN the system SHALL measure build time improvements for each alternative
3. IF multi-architecture support is possible THEN the system SHALL provide x86_64 deployment configuration
4. WHEN implementing alternative deployment THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing AWS App Runner infrastructure
5. WHEN deployment optimization is complete THEN build times SHALL be reduced by at least 50%

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to maintain the current AgentCore functionality while optimizing deployment, so that performance and reliability are not compromised.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing deployment alternatives THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing AgentCore runtime capabilities
2. WHEN optimizing deployment THEN Bedrock integration SHALL remain fully functional
3. WHEN changing architecture THEN TiDB connectivity for both SQL and vector operations SHALL be maintained
4. IF deployment strategy changes THEN the system SHALL provide rollback mechanisms
5. WHEN optimization is deployed THEN system performance SHALL match or exceed current benchmarks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a development team, I want clear migration paths for existing agents, so that we can adopt the optimized deployment without disrupting current services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration strategy is defined THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step migration documentation
2. WHEN migrating existing agents THEN the system SHALL support zero-downtime deployment
3. IF migration issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide automated rollback capabilities
4. WHEN migration is complete THEN all existing agent endpoints SHALL remain accessible
5. WHEN new deployment is active THEN monitoring and logging SHALL continue without interruption
